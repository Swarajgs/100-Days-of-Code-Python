This Python program calculates the amount each person needs to pay when splitting a bill, including the tip. The user is prompted to input the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage (from options of 10%, 12%, or 15%), and the number of people sharing the bill.
  User Input: It collects the total bill amount, the tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill.
  Tip Calculation: It calculates the total tip amount based on the given percentage and adds it to the original bill to get the total bill.
  Splitting the Bill: It divides the total bill by the number of people to determine how much each person should pay.
  Output: Finally, it rounds the amount each person needs to pay to two decimal places and displays the result.
  This program is useful for quickly determining how much each person owes after dining out, ensuring everyone knows their share of the total bill.
